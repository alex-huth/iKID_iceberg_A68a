RUN makes a 30x3 element conglomerate berg. The leftmost column of elements are static. The rightmost column will be assigned an additional shear force during the model run. This is the cantilever beam test from Section 3.2 of Wang 2020 "A scale-invariant bonded particle model for simulating large deformation and failure of continua"
