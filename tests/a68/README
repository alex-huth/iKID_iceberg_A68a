TO RUN THE EXPERIMENT IN THE PAPER:

I. Make the iceberg input files:
   cd makeberg; ./RUN_for_paper; cd ..

II. The full run from the paper:
   ./long_run_for_paper.sh

III. Animate the results:
./animate_trajectories.py -fname=longrun_od_17.8_tn_ng_ydn.1_ss90_ns18_rx-37.51_ry-55.2166.nc



ADVANCED: TUNING EXPERIMENTS:

1. Tuning ocean drag coefficients (by scaling the default point-particle coefficients) and Youngs Modulus: run the simulation without fracture or grounding, and test different parameter values. The following run without fracture/grounding was used for tuning in the paper:
   ./RUN_test_init_for_paper.sh

2. Spinup for fracture tuning: Repeat the run from (1) to just before the first breakup to create a restart file, which will be used by experiments to tune the fracture parameters (step 6, below). To run the spinup used for the paper:
   cp square_for_restart_od_17.8_ydn.1_ss90.nml input.nml
   ./RUN_1p.sh

3. Copy the restart to a new directory:
   cp INPUT/ S_17.8_ydn.1_ss90_r/

5. Rerun the simulation from the restart, this time activating grounding and fracture.
   ./RUN_restart_for_paper.sh

6. animate the results:
   ./animate_trajectories.py -fname=sq_ssfg_gc1.e4_od17.8_rx-37.51_y-55.2166_n18_t10_ss90.nc


Warning: steps 1 and 6 probably require different versions of python or packages. TODO: fix this.
