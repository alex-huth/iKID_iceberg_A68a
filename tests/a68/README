TO RUN THE EXPERIMENT IN THE PAPER/AGU 2021:

1. Make the iceberg input files:
   cd makeberg; ./RUN_for_paper; cd ..

2. (optional) Run the spinup without fracture or grounding, and test different ocean scaling, etc. These tests are used to determine which simulation best follows the observed A68:
   ./RUN_test_init_for_paper.sh

3. Run the selected spinup (which uses ocean_scaling=17.8) to the point for restart:
   cp square_for_restart_od_17.8_ydn.1.nml input.nml
   ./RUN_1p.sh

4. Copy the restart to a new directory:
   cp INPUT/ S_17.8_ydn.1_r/

5. Rerun the simulation from the restart, this time activating grounding and fracture:
   ./RUN_restart_for_paper.sh

6. animate the results:
   ./animate_trajectories.py -fname=sq_ssf_ssg1.e4_od17.8_addsm.true._rectx-37.5285_y-55.2166_n23_t10.nc


Warning: steps 1 and 6 probably require different versions of python or packages. TODO: fix this.
