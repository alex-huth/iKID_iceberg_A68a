# (improved) Kinematic Iceberg Dynamics: iKID/KID

iKID/KID is a Lagrangian element model of icebergs. Initially, the icebergs were represented as infinitesimal points (Martin & Adcroft, 2010), and then given finite extent and element-element interactions so that can now represent giant tabular icebergs by joining elements togeter (KID; Stern et al., 2017). Finally, the code was reimagined to include a multiple-timestepping scheme, shear and torque terms, fracture, and grounding, and was used to simulate the Dec 2020 breakup up iceberg A68a (iKID; Huth et al., 2022)
